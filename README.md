Track The Binding of Isaac in Terminal.

Okay, I'm not really a coder and this code I'm posting will show how much I suck.

The way this whole thing works is through some half assed work around I created to 
avoid finding a method to keep the log file open in C#.

I thought about it and came up with some awful work around to keep the script refresing every five seconds in bash.

It does work and all it requires is sh i.sh to run in the terminal. 

You must download both of the bash files and put them in your home folder. You will also have to compile the C# file yourself. 

You will have to edit one of the the bash files and change it to the location where C#.exe is residing.
